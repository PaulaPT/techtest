# TechTest

TechTest is a Vue 3 application built with Vite, as a showcase of technical skills. It leverages a mock API, using Axios for data fetching and json-server to provide a simulated backend. The project incorporates additional libraries including Tailwind CSS for styling, Pinia for state management, Eslint for code linting, FuseJS for fuzzy search implementation, and RemixIcons for custom iconography.
